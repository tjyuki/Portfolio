                    <p>I'm Tami Johnson. I'm a young developer in the South Salt Lake/South Jordan Area of Utah who loves front-end development and design. I started coding about a year ago, from the humble realms of self-learning through Codecademy and
                        Code School. In the last 3 months, I've had the opportunity to develop a couple projects and work in a team with other developers. I want to continue to build new projects, work in other teams, learn new frameworks and delve more
                        into UI Design.
                    </p>
                    <p>Since I was little, I've always wanted to work with animals in one way or another. Meeting my husband, and continuously being inspired by his ideas and ambitions, has steered me into web development. I've learned how powerful web development
                        really is, and I want to be able to help my husband pursue his start-up businesses, as well as other family members and friends who need websites. Eventually, I want to find a way to help animals with my skills in coding, someway
                        somehow. I love working on teams, and finding opportunities to serve those around me. I'd love to help you out, too!</p>
